This is a bot that uses keyboard inputs to control the movements of a character. It is suitable for games that use keyboard input to move the player's character or take in-game actions.

Currently the bot is adapted for a popular game series of Pocket Monsters. Its purpose is to encounter wild creatures and search for a specific (rare) one. 
During an ecounter with wild creatures, the programme takes a screenshot and reads the name and type of the creature. 
Then it calculates what actions need to be taken and resolve the combat either by defeating the enemy or capture it using the game's methods. 
The process repeats until either a user termination or a specific creature has been captured.
